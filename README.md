### Get Started Immediately

You can use the Harmony IDE, hosted and provided by the HarmonyLang Project, at [https://harmony.cs.cornell.edu/ide](https://harmony.cs.cornell.edu/ide).

If you'd like to build and run your own version, follow the instructions below.

## Running the Harmony IDE

**You’ll need to have Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
